Q1. Where are we instantiating instances of the Property class?

property_1 = Property.new
property_2 = Property.new

Q2. Where are we defining the SQL that enables us to save the ruby Property object into the database?

sql = "INSERT INTO property_tracker (
address,
value,
no_of_bedrooms,
year_built )
VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4)
RETURNING id"

Q3. In console.rb, which lines modify the database?

Property.delete_all
property_1.save
Property_2.save
property_1.value = 150000
property_1.update

Q4. Why do we not define the id of a Property object at the point we instantiate it (‘new it up’)?

ID should be a set number and should not be altered. This is why we use PRIMARY KEY when adding it
to the table

Q5. Where and how do we assign the property id (that is generated by the database) to the ruby object?

def initialize (options)
    @id = options['id'].to_i if options['id']

Q6. Why do we put a guard (an ‘if’ clause) on the @id attribute in the constructor?

So that an ID will only be assigned to something if it actually exists. Otherwise
it would be assigning something to nil.

Q7. Why are some of the CRUD actions represented by instance methods, and others, class methods?

The actions used on instance methods only alter or change one property of a specific instance
Actions used on the class require access to everything within the class to alter or change it

Q8. What type of data structure is returned by db.exec() and db.exec_prepared(), and how do we index into it to pull out a desired attribute?

It returns an array, in the property example this is an array of hashes. To specify which item we want we use the index number
e.g [0]

Q9. Why do we use prepared statements when performing database operations?

To prevent from sql injections/attack

Q10. What do they take in as their arguments?

For ID it takes whatever ID no is inputted and uses "SELECT * FROM property_tracker WHERE id = #{input}"
to find it in the database

I didn't complete the address method but I would guess that it is similar but ID is replaced with address

Q11. What are their return values?

The found item, which is then put into an altered array through .map
